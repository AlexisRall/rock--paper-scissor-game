# Coding Project 1
# Project Name : 🪨, 📃 or ✂️ Anyone?
# Date: 22 June 2025

This is my first Python coding project for my portfolio.
It is the end of my first semester studying Computer Sciences. We have been tackling Python, specifically files, databases, lists, loops, etc.
I decided to do a project outside of my course to build my portfolio.
I intend on doing a coding project every month from now on.

love, lex💗
